# 🚗 Predictive Manufacturing Failures in ECU using Machine Learning

This project aims to detect and predict potential failures in Electronic Control Units (ECUs) during manufacturing using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify defects early, reduce waste, and enhance production quality and efficiency.

## 🔍 Overview

Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are critical components in automotive systems. Failures during or after the manufacturing process can lead to significant safety and cost issues. By analyzing production data using ML models, this project enables:

- Early failure prediction
- Root cause analysis
- Improved quality assurance

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

We use a supervised learning model trained on historical ECU production data. The workflow includes:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing or faulty data
   - Normalization and encoding
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Sensor readings
   - Test results
   - Manufacturing metadata (timestamps, batch IDs)
3. **Model Selection**
   - Random Forest Classifier (initial model)
   - XGBoost (optional upgrade)
4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision/Recall
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC Score

## 🗃️ Dataset

> **Note:** Due to NDA/Privacy concerns, the original dataset is not included. You may use synthetic or publicly available ECU datasets for testing.

Example structure:
ECU_ID | Temperature | Voltage | Pressure | Test_Result | Failure (0/1)
